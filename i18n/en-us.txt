Hello, world!

Hello, world! A new adventure starts today,
With lines of code, we'll find our way.
In every loop and every line,
A journey begins, so pure, divine.

Hello, world! The screen's our stage,
We write the future, page by page.
No limits here, just endless skies,
Let's code, and let our dreams arise.
